  <p>The League of Scholar-Champions was founded by Titans QB Ryan Tannehill in Week 10 of the 2019 NFL Season, when he hit WR Adam Humphries over the middle for a 23-yard touchdown to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-32. This inspired a young generation of degenerates to blend their love of dudes, financial recklessness, alhlcol, suffering, and The Shield to elevate their brotherhood to a League.</p>
  <p>Soon after, Jordan Stone was officially on the clock for the 2020 draft as the eternal grapple for the Kate'smom Trophy (physical trophy TBD) and to avoid the Sacko began. Some teams calculated strategic moves to position themselves for supremacy over their peers. Others spent second-round picks on Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Miles Sanders, and Kenyan Drake. And lo, the unending journey began.</p>
  <p>Each year, only one manager will taste the glory of the League of Scholar-Championship, joining their players in the pantheon of league history. Many others will brave the long offseason as their dreams are deferred.</p>
